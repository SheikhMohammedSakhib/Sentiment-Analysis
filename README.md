This repository contains Python code for sentiment analysis on airline-related tweets. The project explores a dataset of tweets, performs data visualization, preprocessing, and uses machine learning techniques to classify sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The analysis includes visualization of sentiment distribution, airline-specific sentiment breakdowns, and the reasons behind negative sentiments. The code showcases data exploration, text preprocessing, machine learning implementation, and evaluation metrics for sentiment classification.
